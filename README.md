# Comments
I thought this assignment was really great!  It gave me my first taste of truly responsive design and I learned a lot.  I had a couple of minor hiccups, but the shadow on the banner really gave me trouble.  I cannot wait to use skills obtained through this assignment to update my personal site! _Thank you!_
